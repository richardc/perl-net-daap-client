This code is made available under the same terms as Perl itself.

dapple is a DAAP library for Perl.  DAAP is the protocol built
on top of HTTP that Apple's iTunes 4 uses to share music.  Most
responses to DAAP requests contain a binary DMAP structure.

This distribution contains:

  Net::DAAP::DMAP    - utility routines for reading and creating DMAP records
  Net::DAAP::Client  - code to talk to a DAAP server

You must have the LWP module set installed to use this code.

  ***
  ***  This is an incomplete release.  There are missing features.
  ***  See the TODO file for future plans.  Expect new releases fast
  ***  until 0.5 or so.

To install these modules, follow these steps:
  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

Be sure to check out examples/itshell, a commandline client for
downloading from iTunes servers.

This code was originally written by Nathan Torkington, based on DAAP
reverse-engineering work by Todd Larason.  Other contributors are
listed in the AUTHORS file.
